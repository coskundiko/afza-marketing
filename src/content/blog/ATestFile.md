# DHI vs FUE: Which Hair Transplant Technique is Better?

Choosing between DHI and FUE hair transplant techniques is one of the most important decisions you'll make. Both are modern, minimally invasive methods, but they have key differences.

## What is FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction)?

FUE is a hair transplant technique where individual hair follicles are extracted from the donor area (usually the back of the head) and transplanted to balding areas.

**FUE Process:**
1. Donor area is shaved
2. Individual follicles extracted with micro-punch tool
3. Recipient area prepared with incisions
4. Follicles implanted into incisions

**FUE Benefits:**
- No linear scar
- Faster recovery (7-10 days)
- Less invasive than strip method
- Can use body hair as donor

**FUE Cost:** $2,000 - $4,000 (Turkey), $8,000 - $15,000 (USA)

## What is DHI (Direct Hair Implantation)?

DHI is an advanced version of FUE. The key difference: follicles are implanted directly using a specialized Choi pen, without creating recipient incisions first.

**DHI Process:**
1. Donor area can be partially shaved
2. Individual follicles extracted (same as FUE)
3. Follicles loaded into Choi pen
4. Implanted directly into scalp (no pre-made incisions)

**DHI Benefits:**
- More precise angle and depth control
- No need to shave recipient area
- Minimal bleeding
- Faster healing (5-7 days)
- Higher graft survival rate

**DHI Cost:** $3,000 - $6,000 (Turkey), $10,000 - $18,000 (USA)

## Key Differences: DHI vs FUE

| Feature | FUE | DHI |

| **Shaving** | Full shave required | Partial shave possible |
| **Implantation** | Two-step (incision + implant) | One-step (direct implant) |
| **Precision** | Good | Excellent |
| **Recovery** | 7-10 days | 5-7 days |
| **Cost** | Lower | Higher (20-30% more) |
| **Procedure time** | 6-8 hours | 8-10 hours |
| **Graft survival** | 90-95% | 95-98% |
